# Bootstrap-portfolio

This is the Bootstrap portfolio

I focused a lot on the overall look and didn't read the instructions clear enough. I tried to replicate as close as I could and realized after spending so much time on the look I limited the time I had to work on the main focus of responsive ness. I added in column sizes, but it feels very plain and could respond better for each html section, but I wanted to get part of both works done over just getting one Semi good and ignoring the Responsive-portfolio.
